## Project Description

The main goal of building a database with part number datasets by manufacturer is to automate the extraction of hardware part numbers from provided part numbers. The source code for this automation is available in the repository: hardware_part_number_extractor. This project aims to clean and standardize .csv files that store part numbers from different automotive manufacturers. Since the hardware input by account number is inconsistent and unreliable—other part numbers are often entered instead of the correct hardware.

The cleaning process includes:
- Filling empty cells;
- Removing unnecessary columns;
- Keeping only the relevant columns with part numbers.
